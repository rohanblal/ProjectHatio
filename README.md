SETUP:
Import all the .java files into any java programming/running application. Make sure to save all the files. I used Eclipse IDE.app for coding and testing the program. I prefer to use Eclipse IDE.
------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run:
Initially, choose the Main class and run the program. A user login interface will appear. The username is "hatio" and password is "hatio123".
------------------------------------------------------------------
How to test:
Then the Project Manager menu opens up showing various options like creating a project, list all projects, view a project and exit. You can create a new project by using "Create a New Project" option. "List all Projects" shows the already existing/completed projects. "View a Project" option is used to manage the todos inside a project and "Exit" to stop the program.
Create project(s) accordingly and once done, use "View a Project" option. It'll ask to choose the desired project. Once selected, project details are shown along with todo menu which consist of Add todo,Edit todo,Delete todo,Mark todo as complete,Mark todo as pending,Export project to Markdown and Go Back.
Add required number off todos using Add todo option. The todo details can be further edited using Edit todo or deleted using Delete todo. Once todo is added, it will ask for description. Give the todo description accordingly and todo will be added successfully. The state of todo is shown aside the given description. The state of todo can be changed using Mark todo as complete/pending options. Therefore you can manage the todos easily.
Once a project is done by, it can be exported into Markdown(.md) file using Export project to Markdown option. This option automatically converts and exports the project into .md file and saves in the default source folder of Eclipse application. This markdown file can be run in any online markdown editor. An example is attatched (ProjectHatio.md)
